# A somewhat over-engineered enter-button

I had found my self in the possession of a bunch of big arcade style buttons after another project... didn't turn out like i wanted it to. So I built an enter-button for "safe" deployment of "dangerous" commands *

Yeah, it is written in Arduino. It is a quick hack, it is okay to use an alledgedly hacky language for hacks.

Press and hold to arm, then press to "fire" a (possibly) devistating enter-stroke.

*No added safety should be implied or assumed by using this button, quite the opposit in fact
